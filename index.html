    <h2>Habitats</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>Evergreen Forests: These forests are made up of evergreen trees and can be found in a variety of temperatures. In more temperate regions, they may feature eucalyptus, banksia, and acacia trees. The trees offer great shade and protection for tigers to elude hunters and pursue their prey because there is no seasonal loss of leaves.</li>
         <li>Mangrove Swamps: Mangrove swamps are found along the coast and are created by mangrove trees in slightly salty tidal waters. They contribute to the development of a diversified, animal-rich ecosystem. The Bengal tiger lives in the Sundarbans Mangrove region between India and Bangladesh.</li>
         <li>Tropical Rainforests: The largest tropical rainforests on Earth are found close to the equator, where they get between 150 and 400 cm of rain annually. They are the most biodiverse places on the globe due to the mix of moisture and temperature. Tropical rainforests are ideal habitats for carnivorous tigers because they are abundant in fauna.</li>
         <li>Savannas: The savanna receives rainfall only once a year and is characterized by grasses and trees that are spread out so that they do not form a canopy.  This gives the tiger plenty of space to roam and hunt.</li>         
         <li>Grasslands: Grassland areas are the most common in the world, with a continuous cover of grasses and fewer taller plants, such as trees and shrubs. They are home to larger mammals that are perfect to serve as a tigers' prey.</li>
         <li>Mountains: Mountains are elevated areas of the Earth's crust with steep sides and exposed bedrock. Surprisingly, some tigers live in mountainous areas. A Bengal tiger population was discovered at 13,000 feet in the Himalayas in 2010.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Personality</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>Unlike other cats, Tigers are great swimmers and like to play in water.</li>
         <li>A Tigers roar can be heard from two miles away</li>
         <li>Even though Lions are known as "king of the Jungle", Tigers are actually stronger than them. The reason Lions get the title of king is because Lions tend to have more "king-like" traits and are much more social than Tigers.</li>
         <li>Tigers tend to hunt alone, although on rare occasions they will share their prey with other Tigers. When there is a group of Tigers they are typically called an ambush or a streak.</li>
         <li>Tigers can't purr, so they instead show that they're happy by squinting their eyes</li>
         <li>A Tigers roar is so powerful it can even paralyze any animal that hears it</li>
         <li>Tigers prefer to stalk and then ambush their prey</li>
